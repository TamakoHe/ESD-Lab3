== Abstract
This lab session aimed to build an instrument amplifier 
and measure its characters such as offset voltage, differential gain and utilize it to determine the sensitivity of a weight sensor.
The choice of resistors were first calculated based on lab session's requirements. Then the circuit was built and verified and its features were measured. The sensor was then used as the amplifier's input and with the amplified voltage signal, the sensor's sensitivity can be worked out.
